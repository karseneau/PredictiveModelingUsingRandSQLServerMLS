# PredictiveModelingUsingRandSQLServerMLS
-----------------------------------------
Get started with Predictive Modeling using R and SQL Server Machine Learning Services

In 2017, Microsoft introduced SQL Server Machine Learning Services letting us run R or Python scripts in SQL Server, and providing easy access to Machine Learning on premises. 

This code sample was created to demo SQL Server MLS in the QLD SQL Server User Group meet on 1st May, 2019
https://www.meetup.com/QLD-SQL-Server-User-Group/events/260102809/

This session will help you get familiar with SQL Server Machine Learning Services. We will go over its components and features, and understand how it brings data scientists and developers closer. As an example, we will build a Predictive Model using R and SQL Server Machine Learning Services.
